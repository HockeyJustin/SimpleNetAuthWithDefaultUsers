# Simple .NET MVC Authentication (ASP.NET Identity) With Seed Default Users

Really simple .NET MVC Application with a seed for creating users/roles. 

All plain text. Obviously one should separate some bits out from here - it's just a starter.

## Requires:

Visual Studio 2017

SQL Server Express (connection string set to .\SQLEXPRESS).
